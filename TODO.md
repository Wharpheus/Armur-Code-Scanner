# Advanced Optimizations for Smart Contract Scanning

## Information Gathered

- Current Solidity scanning uses Slither, Mythril, and Solc for security, gas, and build issues.
- Config detection supports Foundry, Hardhat, Truffle frameworks with version and remapping extraction.
- Results categorized into SECURITY_ISSUES, GAS_ISSUES, BUILD_ISSUES.
- Tools run sequentially, with Docker fallback.
- No custom rules or advanced analysis like upgradeability or DeFi-specific checks.

## Plan

1. **Add Advanced Tools Integration**
   - Integrate Oyente for symbolic execution.
   - Add Securify for property verification.
   - Include SmartCheck for static analysis.
   - Use Docker for all tools to ensure consistency.

2. **Enhance AST-Based Analysis**
   - Modify Solc tool to parse and analyze AST for deeper insights (e.g., function complexity, state variables).
   - Extract contract inheritance, modifiers, and events for better categorization.

3. **Custom Solidity Rules with Semgrep**
   - Create custom Semgrep rules for Solidity-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy patterns, unchecked sends).
   - Add rules for DeFi attacks (flash loans, oracle manipulation).
   - Integrate into existing Semgrep runner.

4. **Parallel Tool Execution**
   - Run Slither, Mythril, Oyente, etc., in parallel using goroutines for faster scanning.
   - Aggregate results without blocking.

5. **Upgradeability and Proxy Analysis**
   - Add checks for proxy patterns (e.g., OpenZeppelin proxies).
   - Detect potential upgrade issues like storage collisions.

6. **DeFi-Specific Security Checks**
   - Rules for common DeFi vulnerabilities (e.g., price manipulation, liquidation issues).
   - Integrate with existing tools or add custom logic.

7. **Improved CWE Mapping and Reporting**
   - Map Solidity issues to CWEs more accurately.
   - Enhance reporting with severity scores and remediation suggestions.

8. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Use Slither's dependency checks or integrate with Npm audit for Solidity dependencies.
   - Check for known vulnerable contracts/libraries.

9. **Benchmarking and Testing**
   - Test against known vulnerable contracts (e.g., from fixtures).
   - Add performance metrics for scanning speed.

10. **AI-Enhanced Fixes**
    - Leverage existing LLM fixer for Solidity-specific code suggestions.
    - Provide context-aware fixes for detected issues.

## Dependent Files to Edit

- `internal/tools/`: Add new tool files (oyente.go, securify.go, smartcheck.go).
- `internal/tasks/tasks.go`: Update Solidity case in RunSimpleScan to include new tools and parallel execution.
- `internal/solidity/config.go`: Enhance for more framework support and advanced config.
- `pkg/utils.go`: Update categorization and reformatting for new issue types.
- `internal/tools/semgrep.go`: Add Solidity-specific rule loading.
- `internal/tools/slither.go`: Enhance for dependency checks.
- `internal/tools/solc.go`: Add AST parsing logic.

## Followup Steps

- Pull and build Docker images for new tools (Oyente, Securify, SmartCheck).
- Test with existing fixtures (e.g., reentrancy contract).
- Update documentation in docs-site.
- Add unit tests for new functionalities.
- Measure performance improvements.
